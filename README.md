# ftp_data

This repository is used to organize and serve large OHI data files from the Mazu ftp site: https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/pressures/data/

Changes to the [front page](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/pressures) are made in website.Rmd (this is also where data are moved from our files to the ftp site). If there are changes to this Rmd file, then the update.R script should be run to update the website.
